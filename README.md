Official implementation of the Spatial Mask Merging (SMM) algorithm, a post-processing algorithm designed to improve instance segmentation in high-resolution images. It addresses the limitations of traditional tiling methods by merging fragmented masks using graph clustering and spatial metrics.

## Highlights
- âš¡ Spatially optimized mask merging using R-tree indexing for efficient spatial queries
- ðŸ§© Graph-based mask clustering for robust merging of overlapping and adjacent instances
- ðŸ§ª Pixel-level overlap and boundary distance metrics ensuring precise spatial consistency
- ðŸ“¦ Compatible with SAHI and other tiling-based inference pipelines for large-scale segmentation
- ðŸ“ˆ Validated on the iSAID benchmark demonstrating significant precision and consistency gains
