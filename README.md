# spatial-mask-merging
Official implementation of the Spatial Mask Merging (SMM) algorithm, a post-processing algorithm designed to improve instance segmentation in high-resolution images. It addresses the limitations of traditional tiling methods by merging fragmented masks using graph clustering and spatial metrics.
