## Algorithm Overview

The **Spatial Mask Merging (SMM)** algorithm performs instance mask refinement by modeling predictions as nodes in a weighted graph, where edge weights express spatial and semantic consistency. The merging process is global, optimizing all candidate relations jointly instead of applying local, greedy rules.

### Main Components

1. **Graph Construction:**  
      Each predicted instance is treated as a vertex in a graph. Edges are established between masks that are spatially close, with edge weights reflecting three factors:  
   - *Spatial proximity* — normalized by distance threshold **τ_d**  
   - *Mask overlap* (IoU) — normalized by **τ_i**  
   - *Confidence consistency* — influenced by detection scores  

   The pairwise edge weight between instances *i* and *j* is computed as:

   ```
   w_ij = β₁ * (1 - D_ij / τ_d)_+ + β₂ * I_ij + β₃ * min(s_i, s_j)
   ```

   where  
   - **D_ij** – boundary distance between masks *M_i* and *M_j*  
   - **I_ij** – intersection-over-union (IoU) between masks  
   - **s_i**, **s_j** – detection confidences of the respective instances  

   The operator *(1 - D_ij / τ_d)_+* denotes the positive part of the normalized distance term (clamped at zero).  

2. **Spatial Pruning via R-tree:**  
   Neighboring masks are efficiently retrieved within a fixed search radius **ρ** using an R-tree spatial index. This ensures the algorithm remains scalable even with dense predictions.

3. **Global Optimization:**  
   Instance grouping is achieved using a correlation clustering objective that balances merging and separation penalties through the parameter **λ**. This provides globally consistent groupings rather than sequential local merges.

4. **Anti-Chaining Constraint:**  
   The anti-chaining threshold **γ** prevents indirect merging of incompatible objects, ensuring that all masks within a merged group are mutually compatible both geometrically and semantically.

## Algorithm Parameters

Spatial thresholds, edge weighting factors, and clustering penalties govern the behavior of the **Spatial Mask Merging (SMM)** algorithm. These parameters control the balance between over-merging and under-merging, spatial sensitivity, and candidate mask selection.

The parameters **τ_d**, **τ_i**, and **ρ** primarily regulate *candidate generation*, while the edge-weight coefficients **β₁**, **β₂**, **β₃**, the *correlation clustering penalty* **λ**, and the *anti-chaining threshold* **γ** influence *partitioning resolution*.  

Optimal values are **application-dependent** and vary based on object density, shape complexity, and whether inference is performed using tiling or full-image processing.

### Tunable Hyperparameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Suggested Range** |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **τ_d** | Distance scale (in pixels) used to normalize spatial proximity in edge weights *w_ij*. | 5–30 |
| **τ_i** | IoU threshold acting as a normalizing factor for overlap contribution. | 0.1–0.9 |
| **ρ** | R-tree search radius (in pixels) for candidate edge generation. | 10–50 |
| **β₁** | Weight of the distance contribution in *w_ij*. | 0.2–0.4 |
| **β₂** | Weight of the IoU contribution in *w_ij*. | 0.4–0.6 |
| **β₃** | Weight of the confidence contribution in *w_ij*. | 0.1–0.3 |
| **λ** | Correlation clustering penalty controlling over-merging vs. under-merging. | 0.1–2.0 |
| **γ** | Pairwise threshold enforcing the anti-chaining constraint. | 0.3–0.7 |

## Mask Merging Function Details

The merging function consolidates clustered detections into unified instances, ensuring semantic and spatial consistency across merged groups.

Given a valid merge group  
**A = {o₁, o₂, …, oₖ}**, where each object **oᵢ = (Mᵢ, bᵢ, sᵢ, ℓᵢ)** consists of a binary mask, bounding box, confidence score, and shared label, the merging function **Φ(A)** produces a new object **oₙₑw** as follows:

1. **Mask Fusion:**  
   Combine all masks using a pixel-wise logical OR.  
   This ensures that all covered pixels remain preserved in the merged result.

2. **Bounding Box Update:**  
   Compute the minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing all boxes in **A**.

3. **Score Aggregation:**  
   Compute the merged confidence either as an arithmetic mean or as a mask-size-weighted mean.

4. **Class Label Assignment:**  
   Since all members of **A** share the same class label, the merged object inherits this label.

The resulting merged object is  
**oₙₑw = (Mₙₑw, bₙₑw, sₙₑw, ℓₙₑw)**.

### Properties of Φ(A)
- **Idempotence:** Φ({o}) = o  
- **Symmetry:** Invariant to the ordering of elements in A  
- **Mask Preservation:** Ensures no loss of coverage, i.e., ⋃ₜ Mᵢₜ ⊆ Mₙₑw  

This formulation guarantees that merging consolidates spatially and semantically consistent detections into coherent instances, improving robustness of tiled inference without chained or inconsistent groupings.
